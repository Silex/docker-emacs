# Description

Run Emacs in a docker!

This project provides different docker images:

- The main images (~500MB) only contain the runtime dependencies for Emacs to run.
- The `-dev` variants (~1400MB) contain additional developer tools such as [Cask](https://cask.readthedocs.io),
  [git](https://git-scm.com) or [Python](https://www.python.org).  The Emacs source is also available at `/opt/emacs` if
  you need to build Emacs differently.
- The `-alpine` variants (~200MB) follow the same logic as the main images but are based on
  [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org).

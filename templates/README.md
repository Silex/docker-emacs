# Description

Run Emacs in docker containers!

This project provides different docker images:

- The main images (~500MB) only contain the runtime dependencies for Emacs to run.
- The `-dev` variants (~1400MB) also contain the build dependencies, the Emacs source (in `/opt/emacs`), and additional
  tools such as [Cask](https://cask.readthedocs.io), [git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org).
- The `-alpine` variants (~200MB) follow the same logic as the main images but are based on
  [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org).
